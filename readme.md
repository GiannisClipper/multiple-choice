## Multiple-choice

This is a demo web application. Back-end and front-end are totally separated. Back-end is a RESTful API developed in Python/Flask, using an SQL database and responding in JSON format. Front-end is a single-page application developed in ReactJS.

Registered users can create their own multiple-choice works/tests. Signing up requires a username, a password and a valid email through which a new account will be activated. Although application follows the recommented security rules (ex. stores hashes instead of actual passwords), __you are advised not to use same passwords like email or bank accounts and not expose other crucial personal data__ (remember is just a demo).

Any user, registered or not, can search existing works/tests by title and run/execute them. Each mutliple-choice work/test may have up to 12 questions and each question up to 8 answers.

Enjoy creating or solving multiple-choice works/tests.
